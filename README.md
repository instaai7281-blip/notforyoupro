## 🌟 Key Features

### 🚀 High-Speed Topic Mirroring Hub (`/mirror`)
- **Complete Forum Supergroup Mirroring**: Automatically scans all topics from source forum and clones them into the target forum supergroup.
- **Auto-Topic Creation & Mapping**: Creates matching forum topics with identical topic titles and icons.
- **Smart Continuation & Resume Engine**: MongoDB-backed session persistence. If interrupted or redeployed, resumes instantly from the exact last mirrored message without creating duplicate topics.
- **Interactive Session Management**: Modify target chat IDs, delete sessions, or continue mirroring with a single click.
- **Real-Time Live Dashboard**: Shows active topic name, file count progress, live transfer speed, ETA, and an interactive **Skip Topic** button.

### 📥 Multi-Source Content Extraction (`/batch`, single links)
- **Restricted Channel/Group Bypassing**: Download and clone protected content (photos, videos, documents, audios, voice notes, stickers, text) from private/public channels and groups.
- **Telethon + Pyrogram Fast Uploader**: Up to 4GB file upload support using userbot session strings.
- **Multi-Client Concurrency**: Automatic load balancing across multiple worker sessions.
- **File Splitting**: Automatically splits files exceeding 2GB/4GB limits.

### 🎨 Advanced Custom Branding & Cleaners
- **Dynamic Blockquote Formatting**: Converts captions and branding tags into clean native Telegram blockquote boxes.
- **Filename Sanitization**: Removes all `@usernames`, `@channels`, and promotional signatures from filenames across all formats (Videos, PDFs, Documents, Audios).
- **Custom Watermarking & Thumbnails**: Support for PDF watermarking and custom/extracted video thumbnail generation.

### 💎 Monetization & User Management
- **Subscription Tiers**: Built-in free vs. premium user limits (`/add`, `/rem`, `/myplan`, `/check`).
- **Shortlink Ads System**: Token-based ad verification system for free users.
- **Auto-Broadcast & Channel Forwarding**: Broadcast announcements and auto-forward messages across channels and groups.
